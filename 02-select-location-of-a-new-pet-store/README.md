## Select the Location of a New Pet Store
##### This project is WIP.
A pet store chain is selecting the location for its next store.

Use data preparation techniques to build a robust analytic dataset and use it to build a predictive model to select the best location.

### Business Problem
Pawdacity is a leading pet store chain in Wyoming with 13 stores throughout the state. This year, Pawdacity would like to expand and open a 14th store. Your manager has asked you to perform an analysis to recommend the city for Pawdacity’s newest store, based on predicted yearly sales.

Your first step in predicting yearly sales is to first format and blend together data from different datasets and deal with outliers.

Your manager has given you the following information to work with:

- The monthly sales data for all of the Pawdacity stores for the year 2010.
- NAICS data on the most current sales of all competitor stores where total sales is equal to 12 months of sales.
- A partially parsed data file that can be used for population numbers.
- Demographic data (Households with individuals under 18, Land Area, Population Density, and Total Families) for each city and county in the state of Wyoming.

### Data
- competitor-sales.csv - Competitor sales
- demographic.csv - Demographic data
- population.csv - Population data
- pawdacity-monthly-sales.csv - Pawdacity monthly sales

### Tasks
- Recommend the city for Pawdacity’s newest store, based on predicted yearly sales.
