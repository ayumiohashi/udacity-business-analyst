## A/B Test a New Menu Launch
A chain of coffee shops is considering launching a new menu.

Design and analyze an A/B test and write up a recommendation on whether the chain should introduce the new menu.

### Business Problem
Round Roasters is an upscale coffee chain with locations in the western United States of America. The past few years have resulted in stagnant growth at the coffee chain, and a new management team was put in place to reignite growth at their stores.

The first major growth initiative is to introduce gourmet sandwiches to the menu, along with limited wine offerings. The new management team believes that a television advertising campaign is crucial to drive people into the stores with these new offerings.

However, the television campaign will require a significant boost in the company’s marketing budget, with an unknown return on investment (ROI). Additionally, there is concern that current customers will not buy into the new menu offerings.

To minimize risk, the management team decides to test the changes in two cities with new television advertising. Denver and Chicago cities were chosen to participate in this test because the stores in these two cities (or markets) perform similarly to all stores across the entire chain of stores; performance in these two markets would be a good proxy to predict how well the updated menu performs.

The test ran for a period of 12 weeks (2016-April-29 to 2016-July-21) where five stores in each of the test markets offered the updated menu along with television advertising.

The comparative period is the test period, but for last year (2015-April-29 to 2015-July-21).

You’ve been asked to analyze the results of the experiment to determine whether the menu changes should be applied to all stores. The predicted impact to profitability should be enough to justify the increased marketing budget: at least 18% increase in profit growth compared to the comparative period while compared to the control stores; otherwise known as incremental lift. In the data, profit is represented in the gross_margin variable.

You have been able to gather three data files to use for your analysis:
- Transaction data for all stores from 2015-January-21 to 2016-August-18
- A listing of all Round Roasters stores
- A listing of the 10 stores (5 in each market) that were used as test markets.
